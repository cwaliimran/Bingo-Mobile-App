please try this API (using POST)
https://6048939bb801a40017cce09c.mockapi.io/api/ManagePlayer?game-id=&session-id=&player-id==&op=JOIN&ver=1
you should replace the place holders with real data from user.
Currently you can put anything and you should get same mock response
Let me know if you get the response

REST Methods should use POST,
But please try to make it easy to replace the POST to GET,
because In the mock server, I put “ok” response to the POST (working flow),
but I put error or different response to the GET,
so that you can check different responses
